All generic FIG86 forths have version number 2.
Preliminary releases derive their version id, in this case as 2.105, from
the RCS version of the generic source file `fig86.gnr' 
Stable versions will use the regular fig numbering. 

Release :
Version 2d105  consists of

Documentation
COPYING         : the conditions under which you are allowed to use all this
release.txt     : this text
figdoc.zip      : general figForth documentation and glossary
figdocadd.txt  *: deviations from the above, plus concretisations for fig86.gnr
fig86gnr.txt    : documentation applicable to all versions about genericity

Source
Makefile        : Make a runnable Forth but also targets for building floppies.
forth.gnr       : generic source
figforth.c      : C-source that complements assembler on Linux.

*.cfg           : Each of these cfg-files stand for some system.
*release.txt   *: if a corresponding *release.txt is present, its intention
                  is that for that system reading of fig86gnr.txt is no
                  longer essential. It remains fruitful. 

Derived sources. For an msdos archive `fig86.' is ommitted.
fig86.alone.asm : nasm source for bootable system using BIOS i/o 16bit protected
fig86.msdos.msm : MASM/TASM source for hosted system using modern MSDOS i/o
fig86.lina.asm  : nasm source for native linux version. 
fig86.linux.asm : nasm source for linux version with I/O in c.

These files are example configurations that can be used out of
the box via the Makefile. 
The first four generate the `Derived files' from the previous section.
alone.cfg       : 16 bit protected mode, boots from floppy, uses BIOS for IO
msdos.cfg       : 16 bit real mode, hosted by MSDOS, blocks in files.
linux.cfg       : 32 bit protected mode, hosted by linux, links with figforth.c
lina.cfg        : 32 bit protected mode, hosted by linux, direct system calls. 
!!alonehd.cfg     : 32 bit protected mode, boots from hard disk, uses BIOS
for IO

!!cfg.zip         : More .cfg files that make sense.

Auxiliary files.
The m4 files are used transparently by the Makefile.
prelude.m4      : Sets defaults. Show configuration options.
postlude.m4     : Makes sure everything is consistent. 
gas.m4          : Included for using gas (experimental, only half way).
nasm.m4         : Included for using nasm.
masm.m4         : Included for using masm/tasm.
header.m4       : Handles the headers. Approximately set threading type.
width16.m4      : Handles 16 bits code.
width32.m4      : Handles 32 bits code.
protect.m4      : Handles switching between real and protected mode.
link.script     : Links a hybrid c/assembler version on Linux.
genboot.bat     : Generate a bootable floppy on an MSDOS system
toblock.c       : Convert a text file to blocks.
fromblock.c    *: Convert from blocks to a text file.
stealconstant.c*: Converted to constant.m4 with Linux symbolic constants.


Example Forth sources.
blocks.frt      : Source for editor assembler decompiler etc. Normal archives.
BLOCKS.BLK      : Same but in block format, supplied in MSDOS archive instead of blocks.frt
wc              : Featuring lina as a script language.

The files marked *: have names too long for plain MSDOS. These names are
truncated if you down loaded the MSDOS archive.
