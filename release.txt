All generic CI86 forths have version number 3.
Preliminary releases derive their version id, in this case as 3.179, from
the RCS version of the generic source file `ci86.gnr'
Stable versions will use a regular numbering, that starts with old FIG :
    1.x (FIG)
    2.x (my FIG)
    3.x CI86

Release :
The previous release was 3.154. There has been no change in the number
of files, and there purpose.

RCS version 3.179 is archived into fig86g3d179.zip and consists of
(this version is named after RCS so it is a beta release)

The source.
Makefile        : Make a runnable Forth but also targets for building floppies.
test.mak        : Gratuitous split off, of some targets for make. Often tests.
ci86.gnr       : Generic source, word documentation and wordset documentation.
ciforth.c      : C-source that complements assembler on Linux.

*.cfg           : Each of these cfg-files stand for some system.
*release.txt   *: A corresponding *release.txt refer to such system.

Documentation
COPYING         : the conditions under which you are allowed to use all this
release.txt     : this text
testreport.txt  : findings of the final testing before this release
cifgen.mi       : generic documentation, how to configure.
ciforth.mi     : Main documentation, and framework
intro.mi        : Beginners introduction to Forth
manual.mi       : User manual (Glossary is generated from ci86.gnr)
rational.mi     : Installation and other expert level info

assembler.txt   : INACCURATE! About the internal assember and
                  the separate assembler project.
editor.txt      : The built in assembler for MSDOS or standalone configurations.

Derived sources. For an msdos archive `ci86.' is ommitted.
This is for your convenience, you could have generated them.
ci86.alone.asm : nasm source for fd-bootable system using BIOS
                    i/o 16bit protected
ci86.alonehd.asm : nasm source for hd-bootable system using BIOS i/o 32bit
ci86.msdos.msm : MASM/TASM source for hosted system using modern MSDOS i/o
ci86.lina.asm  : nasm source for native linux version.
ci86.linux.asm : nasm source for linux version with I/O in c.
ci86.msdos32.asm : nasm source for hosted system using modern MSDOS i/o, 32 bit.

These files are example configurations that can be used out of
the box via the Makefile.
The first six generate the `Derived files' from the previous section.
alone.cfg       : 16 bit protected mode, boots from floppy, uses BIOS for IO
msdos.cfg       : 16 bit real mode, hosted by MSDOS, blocks in files.
linux.cfg       : 32 bit mode, hosted by linux, start up and I/O in c. (64M)
lina.cfg        : 32 bit mode, hosted by linux, system calls in assembler.(64M)
msdos32.cfg     : 32 bit mode, hosted by MSDOS, blocks in files. (8M)
alonehd.cfg     : 32 bit mode, boots from hard disk, uses BIOS for IO. (128M)

cfg.zip         : More .cfg files that make sense. If available.

Auxiliary files.
These m4 files are used transparently by the Makefile for making
different .asm files with the corresponding . rawdoc files.
prelude.m4      : Sets defaults. Show configuration options.
postlude.m4     : Makes sure everything is consistent.
gas.m4          : Included for using gas (experimental, only half way).
nasm.m4         : Included for using nasm.
masm.m4         : Included for using masm/tasm.
header.m4       : Handles the headers. Approximately set threading type.
width16.m4      : Handles 16 bits code.
width32.m4      : Handles 32 bits code.
protect.m4      : Handles switching between real and protected mode.
ssort           : regular expression sort. Contact me if you want source.

These m4 files are used transparently by the Makefile for making
documentation files from the .mi files and one .rawdoc file.
The above m4 are also needed still.
gloss.m4        : Layout of glossary section in texinfo
glosshtml.m4    : Layout of glossary section in html
indexhtml.m4    : Sorted index for html
manual.m4       : Generate texinfo markups
menu.m4         : Generate the wordset menu
names.m4        : Names in the documentation for easy change.
wordset.m4      : Generate texinfo chapters linkage.

genboot.bat     : Generate a bootable floppy on an MSDOS system
toblock.c       : Convert a text file to blocks.
fromblock.c    *: Convert from blocks to a text file.
stealconstant.c*: Converted to constant.m4 with Linux symbolic constants.

System Forth sources. Example Forth sources.
blocks.frt      : Source for editor assembler decompiler etc. Normal archives.
BLOCKS.BLK      : Generated from blocks.frt but in block format,
                  Supplied in MSDOS archive instead of blocks.frt
wc              : Featuring lina as a script language.

The files marked *: have names too long for plain MSDOS. These names are
truncated if you down loaded the MSDOS archive.
